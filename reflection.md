## Reflection Document

### HTML

Most of the exercises I tried to do on my own, but a lot of the times I found myself stuck and would need to fall back on the videos and or the solutions.

I thought these exercises were super helpful and applied directly to the homework we would work on. Although I feel like I was lacking in my homeworks, I did try my best for these lab notebooks, albeit, a little procrastination happened. An exercise I found particularly helpful was all of the HTML I feel like in terms of web development, those are super important and are vital in my toolbox for CS.

I don't think there's any spots where there needs to be reworking in the HTML file, I think it's beginner and really self explanatory.

### Accessibility

I did all of the accessibility checks on my own and tried to fix the issues when running Wave or Lighthouse on the files that I would fill out.

I loved this section of the class and I feel really good being able to know that I am developing web applications that are accessible to all users. I found it especially helpful learning about ARIA and screen readers (even though they are super annoying when listening to them).

I didn't really have any issues with this section of the labs which is why I liked it a lot as well. Super informative and applicable to the real world.

### CSS

A lot of the CSS, I tried to do on my own but like the HTML, I fell back on the videos and solutions a lot. But having the solutions there and following along with the video helped me understand it more.

CSS is so useful and I really liked this section of the labs as well. I like being in control of the color schemes of my web application, or being able to dictate what kind of border my images will have. I like the creative freedom I have with it.

Some troubles that I had with this lab was that I got confused a lot of the times with syntax and when to use the '.' for classes within the HTML files.

An exercise that I liked a lot but it wasn't on the lab was the diner CSS selectors. I think that helped me a lot with the syntax and why I'm labelling the calsses the way that I am.

### Flexbox

Flexbox was a fun exercise section in our labs. I did have to fall back on the videos and solutions but like the CSS it was easier for me to understand and follow along the videos.

There wasn't a particular exercise in the Flexbox that was my favorite. I think with the exercise, it tested my limit in what I understand about CSS syntax which I thought was useful.

I don't think there was any place in the exercise that needed improvement in my opinion.

### CSS Grid

The CSS Grid was so fun to do. I think I would say I did a lot of it and then places I felt stuck I would watch the videos or go to the solutions.

An exercise in particular that I liked in the CSS grid was the grid areas because we weren't just splitting up a screen, we were splitting up a screen with HTML elements.

Some troubles I had initially was and probably will always be syntax. Luckily working on VSCode, it helps a lot with finishing what I need if I don't have a specific name for it or am having trouble in finishing out the section.

### Bootstrap

Bootstrap in general was pretty difficult for me to do and what not so I had a harder time with these exercises, which meant I fell back on the videos and solutions.

I think since my knowledge in Bootstrap was limited, I enjoyed a lot of the exercises in the lab because they were all really informative and had something different in each section.

Again, I don't think there was any part of this exercise that I didn't like / particularly need because of my already lack of knowledge.

I wish there was more exercises like the diner game for Bootstrap, I feel like that would be really fun hehe

### Javascript

Javascript was pretty high on the difficulty level. I think I needed to devote some time in researching it and fully understanding what I was doing before doing with the solutions and videos.

I really like the replace exercise. I thought that was a cool exercise and I never knew that you could replace words and everything. Even though JS is a little hard to catch on, I really enjoyed learning more, since JS is so universally used.

I don't think there are any areas of improvement for this assignment, more on my part on my lack of knowledge.

### JQuery

I was completely lost on this lab so I had to look it up on the solutions and videos.

Out of the dom and ajax exercise I think I liked the explanation for the ajax more. Although there was a lot more that was required in the assignment, it challenged me and forced me to follow pretty closely to the solutions and videos.
